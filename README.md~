# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my Neovim configuration (`init.vim`). It leverages several plugins to enhance productivity, including CoC for language support, Airline for status line customization, and NERDTree for file exploration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Neovim 0.5.0+**: Ensure that you have Neovim installed.
- **Git**: Required for cloning the repository.
- **[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)**: A minimalist Vim plugin manager.

### Steps

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pram11/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2. **Install plugins:**

    Open Neovim and run the following command:

    ```vim
    :PlugInstall
    ```

    This will download and install all plugins specified in the `init.vim` file.

3. **Start Neovim:**

    If Neovim is opened without any file arguments, NERDTree will launch automatically.
